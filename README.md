# CacheUnitProject

# **Java project , Part 2,3 - MMU - Cache Unit and Server implementation**

**This part of the MMU project includes the Server interface**

In this project I have created a Memory management unit which is using the concept of “Cache memory” to give the user the ability to access and store data more efficiently.\
The system was built by using “Paging Algorithms” like :\
LRU – least recently used\
NRU – not recently used\
Random Replacement Algorithm

I have created a Client – Server  interface which is accessed by the client using the GUI – (Graphical user Interface). The GUI was implemented using SWING. The code was tested using Junit 5.\
The main features that were used in this project are:\
Object Oriented Programming\
Design patterns:

Strategy pattern\
Observer pattern\
Singleton 

Multi Threading\
Open/Closed principle\
Generics\
Unit testing (Junit)
